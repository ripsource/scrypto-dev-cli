/**
 * This module exports a set of classes and objects for hosting the Radix Engine Toolkit WASM and
 * invoking functions on it. The following are the layers of abstraction maintained by this module:
 *
 * ┌───────────────────────┐
 * │ RadixEngineToolkit    │
 * ├───────────────────────┤
 * │ RawRadixEngineToolkit │
 * ├───────────────────────┤
 * │ Host                  │
 * └───────────────────────┘
 *
 * Each of the above classes builds on top of one another. {@link Host} is the lowest level of the
 * stack and just provides a WASM host (runtime) and some serialization with no knowledge of the
 * function that the toolkit has. Other classes such as {@link RadixEngineToolkit} build upon this
 * exposing a high-level API for consumers.
